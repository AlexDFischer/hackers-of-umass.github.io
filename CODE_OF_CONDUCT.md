# Hackers of UMass: Official Code of Conduct

*Last updated 6/21/2015*

---

### Introduction

This Code of Conduct "The Code" governs how any member of the Hackers of UMass
is expected to behave at any meetings, events, or online discussions sanctioned by us. We
expect everyone who is affiliated with the club to honor it.

### Our Policies

We strive to provide an environment, for all members, that is safe, educational,
fun, and entirely free of harassment or discrimination. What does that mean? A few things:

* We do not discriminate based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, ethnicity, race, religion, software development experience, or degree.
* We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination in any form.
* Sexual imagery or language is not tolerated.

Club members who violate any of the above will be reached out to, and repeat
offenders will be permanently banned, without exception, from:

* Attending our events or events sanctioned by us
* Participating in any online community we moderate (such as the Facebook group)
* Recieving our newsletters and other club communications

### Questions or Concerns

If any of the above language seems unclear or ambiguous, please reach out to us
at [hackersofumass@gmail.com](mailto:hackersofumass@gmail.com) and we will gladly
explain in more detail.
